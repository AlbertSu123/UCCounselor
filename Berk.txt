i have the utmost respect for my alma matter basically the college experience is what you make it just as in life i had wonderful though provoking and caring instructors fun discussion groups challenging tests and homework and fun time exploring telegraph shattuck and parts of berkeley berkeley itself can be filled with squatters but the campus itself is beautiful with its hills trees beautiful classic architecture my favorite building is the hearst mining building and the brick ones along the walking path to the remodeled california memorial stadium you will get an academic experience of a lifetime here as long as you apply yourself get to know your professors and your peers go bears! berkeley is not a safe space! i thought when entering that berkeley would be a place that i could feel safe in a liberal atmosphere let me be frank i joined a political science class where different speakers came in the speakers were all fine mainly democrats who were currently running but near the end of the semester they showed three conservative speakers! i felt like i had been violated berkeley is supposed to be a place where i can feel safe and not have to listen to aggravating opposing viewpoints the fact that 10% of the class showed speakers who were conservative rather than liberal shows that this university doesn't care about us! i also heard a student (white male) who said that whites were a minority at berkeley just because they are only around 20% of the population does he not know how privileged whites are? white people never have any problems in life ever because they are white that's a fact you should do your research! these 5 stars go to stephen torie and katie who were instrumental in making my "big game" experience wonderful stephen gave me a ride up the hill to the stadium and he had a good personalitywhen i was having a very minor problem with the bobblehead give away tori took care of the situation immediately katie was giving away posters and when i asked for a rubber band she went out of her way to get me oneforget what fun berkeley has to offer it isn't much but if you go to the school make sure you get great grades network and start making lots of money because the real world will suck if you don't! forget about majors like isf arts or anything that doesn't tie skills to a job your curiosities despite what professors may tell you are useless your knowledge and skills are only useful to get yourself employed or perhaps better self-employed! oh yeah the out-of-political spectrum protests and random causes are garbage - make friends who are on a great track to making lots of money you'll need it to live anywhere decent unless of course you want to walk everyday past and live near somewhere like people's park when you grow up only in more sketchier dangerous and expensive places all which seem to strangely be clunked together! good luck go bears!uc berkeley is celebrating its 150th year anniversary it has a fairly lively academic history and is a symbol of social and political change among progressives i visited here primarily to roam the east asian collection and archives to collect some data the east asian library itself is very well designed with many different spaces to sit and enjoy a book the staff is also very helpful in assisting you to find books you need the exterior could use some cleaning but the interior of the library is spotless chic and modernthe campus is beautiful overall and even tourists can enjoy the wonderful architecture and general ease of atmosphere at uc berkeley it is a kid-friendly area to stroll with the family but children might get pretty bored and you will stick out like a sore thumb walking around with your stroller however there are many pockets of this campus for you to enjoy some quietude just be careful about walking over the giant circle plaques around campus otherwise you might ruin your (or your child's) chances of getting a 40 gpa! although i am not a cal alumni myself i have friends and family who are and i have been in berkeley for many different reasons from parties to research and work i've had the chance to experience cal in many different ways and i have to say it's probably in my top 3 universities in the us the last time i was up in berkeley was during the spring time on a rainy day and it was beautiful the campus and the city itself is just amazing the botanical garden was closed due to the rain which was the reason we all went to the school that day fortunately that day specifically there was also a guest speaker the man was an astrophysicist explaining very interesting stuff the room was packed and it was really a fun experience and that was just coincidental they are definitely one of my top choices for my masters and possibly my phd wish me luck getting in though make sure to check out the city when you're in the area and check out the old shops as well there's lots of history in this place especially during vietnam very interesting stuffuc berkeley celebrates its 150th birthday this year so it is about time i write a review of the fine institution that opened up so many doors for me personally and professionally 'a0my review just happens to be almost 20 years late since i am recollecting my experiences here as a doctoral student in their chemical engineering department starting in the mid 90's! 'a0at the time ucb was top 5 in every department and #1 in chemistry 'a0its probably the same todaygrad vs undergrad: 'a0i think undergraduates have it tougher since you are competing for grades and investing lots of $$$ for tuition/room/books 'a0for graduate programs in engineering/chemistry tuition is free and they even give you a small monthly stipend 'a0you need to be a teaching assistant for a few semesters and conduct 1-2 years of original research for master's or 4-6 years for a phd 'a0grades don't matter as much in grad school - maintain a b- and you'll keep getting paid and will eventually graduate!skills i learned: getting grilled by professors and fellow classmates in oral exams and presentations is great practice for real life 'a0so are writing papers to report your findings or proposals asking for grant money 'a0and all that freedom of managing a budget building your experimental rig and collecting data independently 'a0lewis hall 317 and 311! 'a0researching and critiquing work done by others and then contributing your share learning by doing sharing and assimilation - mostly on your own 'a0things i miss: strada biancha mocha at cafe strada pickup basketball games at rsf late night eats at top dog steve's bbq on durant weekend chess tournaments at mlk student unionbest moments: passing my qualifying exam and having the senior grad students in my group pop open champagne to celebrate 'a0getting that first job offer which although was not the most stable nor the highest paying eventually led to far greater things 'a0plus all the friendships from my classmates many who i bump into at technical conferences and business travels favorite professors: cjk was my thesis advisor and took a hands-off approach 'a0he never got angry and gave grandfatherly advice and enough direction for me to find my path 'a0i only saw him every few weeks since he had a side job as uc provost based out of oakland! 'a0jmp was my mentor through qualifying exams and was one of the greatest teachers always starting classes with great stories 'a0cjr intimidated me at first since he grilled me through prelims and qualifiers and then he was on my thesis committee 'a0i've grown to respect him and he even asked me to ta for him for an extra semester!closing thoughts - going through cal's doctorate program takes sacrifice and you'll be poor for a few years while your friends are likely working and making money and having fun 'a0for me it was well worth it since i developed so much and made many connections 'a0the company i now work for has very strong ties to cal 'a0at one point it was called "north berkeley" since so many alum worked therego bears!it does seem ridiculous to review a school campus doesn't it? however this is my alma mater so i am biased enough to submit this highly condensed thesis for your consideration as my 3900th review go bears! yes i was a young naive bear cub during the carter administration back when us presidents were public figures we admired i remembered how nervous i was to be living away from home for the first time and how large the campus felt between classes over 1200 acres though the core campus is about 178 there was an amazing falafel wrap served in a long ago orange and yellow cart at the foot of telegraph that i took past sather gate and over to dwinelle plaza to eatyep dwinelle hall meant comp lit classes wheeler hall was poli sci evans hall was calculus (dreaded that one) and tolman hall was psychology i'm guessing little of that has changed in the intervening years and all those hallowed halls are still there amazing i still remember those building names especially considering how many more buildings there are now but uc berkeley is that kind of school that provided a diverse climate of academia that shaped my formative years i also had my first doobie in the stock room of the asuc store where i worked all four years i was there  tmi? well can i say that you can still get quite a view from the top of the campanile ok thenbeautiful campus lots of color nature and knowing that my little brother goes here is such an inspiration love this area love this school go bears!i had the opportunity to spend the day here on cal day as the parent of an accepted student my child was deciding between some great school choices and i am deciding how to find legitimate ways to 'a0pay for a college education ucb is impressive as a long-standing academic institution and is the initial bedrock of the uc system it has an impressive name and reputation in the community and it is certainly fun to see the free-spirited liberalness that pervades the student body in fact i think that if you are even just left of center you will stick out like a right-wing sore thumb since everyone here seems to be actively crusading for somethingi was so prepared to love this place for my child that i was running financial simulations in my head on the way there to determine the best way to help pay for out of state tuition once there and having sat through 3 separate tours outlining what your child is likely to experience i quickly realized that the glamour in my head was short lived probably the best example of this is the business school freshmen cannot enroll there they must work to be accepted there as a junior but there is only a 30% acceptance rate the other way to look at this is that if your child has their dream set on graduating from their haas school of business there is a 70% chance that they will fail to do so and that is after you have paid a lot of money for them to be halfway through their education that just seems unfair and unwise from a parental budget standpoint the haas tour was also a downer the buildings and spaces were beautiful but the student guide told us that the ucb community "frowns" on business students because it sees them as interested in corporate capitalism and the culture of ucb is so left-leaning that it tolerates it but does not support it so they tried to spin the fact that your child has a 70% chance of not getting in to the haas school of business as a good thing in other words if your child is not a haas student they will fit in much better here and have a happy berkeley experience not really a good marketing plan for a prospective parent to hear we spoke with other students during the day that confirmed this they started out wanting to be haas students but failed to make the cut so they told me that they had to go to plan b which usually involved getting a degree in some type of social preventative justice equality field but they all ended this plan b explanation with "but its a degree from berkeley so i will be just fine" that sounds a bit like brainwashing to meone thing that was really clear to me was that you don't get a lot here for your money if you only visit the uc system you may think that it offers a lot but having compared it to other states and their university systems there are tremendous values and opportunities elsewhere that guarantee a pathway for your student where they can realize all of their dreams of course northern cal is a beautiful area but that is not really a checkbox on the list of how to choose a good school that will help to ensure success i walked away from the day feeling like ucb is a big name in a beautiful area but there are a lot of students there that were forced to take a path that was not originally intended as an institute of higher learning there is plenty to like here but as you peel away the layers it becomes questionable if all of the opportunities will exist for your student as a prospective parent i'm convinced that they could do better (or at least sell it better) the entire day actually scared us offcome here if you want no one to give a shit about you professors are egotistical assholes fs24 fs28 both my parents attended cal berkeley albeit in different eras 'a0my mom went back to college as a woman with 3 kids at home while my dad had gone when he first emigrated to the states 'a0lots of family memories here! i suspect that the beauty of the campus' layout and landscaping didn't change that much between the late 40s and the late 60s 'a0other changes ensued with the addition of more modern buildings for certain departments in the latter decades of the 20th century driving around the campus a few weeks ago most of it was still familiar from times i spent there with my mother in the late 60s / early 70s 'a0several high school field trips offered additional perspectives like being at cal when the world was supposed to end in 1974 'a0just happened to be there that day to visit their on campus art museumi got my first pair of contact lenses there as a teenager at a discount because my mom was a student and the school of optometry offered reduced cost services 'a0the better to train budding clinicians!the upper reaches of the sprawling campus offer stupendous views of the san francisco bay on clear days 'a0it occupies an impactful physical and cultural space in east bay which are hard to denyif i'm giving stanford 5 stars this can only be 4 starsfrom purely a campus perspective berkeley is still great it's quite sizable but with more of a nature-y feel to it however it doesn't have the same landmarks and sights but there's still a lot to see it also has a large outer campus life with tons of shops stores and restaurants right nextdoorthey are merciless with giving parking violations with one sign at the beginning entrance that others parked near me did not see either so caution visiting the campus just to check it out even though it's beautiful campus you will get ticketed right away if you are in the parking zone that is for permit only even if it is confusing 'a0uc berkeley parking and transportation citation services and berkeley in general have terrible parking restrictions they love giving their visitors tickets 'a0 what a friendly way to create an income stream!i am very fortunate to go to cal i love the campus the diverse people i have met and my professors my first year has been very challenging but i enjoy itthis school is by far the most racist school i have ever attended! initially i was proud to have been accepted into uc berkeley! if you are a student of color you will understand what i am talking about! there is reason why some african american students decide to go elsewhere! the bottom line is they don't feel welcomed! in addition the treatment of students who have disabilities is down right despicable! shame on you berkeley! shame on you! if i was a caucasian student with rich parents this kind of abuse would not have taken place! you guys would be sued! the chancellor of school also is a phony along with the executive director from dsp! the theater department is another one bunch of racist pretentious snobs! shame on you guys! shame on you! warning if you are a conservative stay away from this school! unless your a bad ass and you know how to kick some butt! the far left in this school completely and utterly despises conservatives people! well that is partially true it may not be 100 percent because berkeley does have a group called the berkeley republicans but they are the minority on campus! hope no one else gets punched in the face for just being a conservative! any way that's all for now!i am a cal student so might be biased but the campus is huge and gorgeous! if you are in the neighborhood definitely take a tour there are so many interesting facts about our campus that still amaze me my 2 favorite spots would be the morrison reading room in doe library and memorial glade so much to see and do around berkeleyas someone who's taken courses at csus community colleges and a uc if you can afford to go to berkeley take the chance and go for it and jump in for the full 4 years it will open up your mind to so many different people from so many different backgrounds far more than you'd ever get if you stayed home with ma and popsthe education at csus is extremely poor compared to what you get at a uc the testing experience is so much more competitive but richer and you form relationships and friendships that last for a lifetime after you leave everyone's got a story to tell here and everyone here is more than a scholarship a test score a valedictorian or a legacy university student you'll find people from all over the world all walks of life but most of us have the intention of making the world a better place in our own waysleave behind your notions of diversity and well-roundedness back at high school at cal it okay to be a highly skilled geek at one task and become the best you can be in that one area because you will find the rest of your team in the classmates around you and they will teach you what your high school could never teach you about diversity and learning through application and learning by doing your professors will often be at the forefront of research in their particular field and you will have opportunities to join their research projects and learn alongside themattending this school was the biggest mistake of my life i only chose berkeley because of its name but i wish people would be more honest about the environment instead of tricking people into believing that it's welcoming to all and that "it's the #1 public university in the world" the food places are gross there's nothing to do around campus students are extremely political and extremely hostile there are homeless people attacking students with foreign objects everyday and nothing is done about it as a student of color you are tricked into believing that because the black population is 3% you should "be here and take up space!" false don't go where you don't want to be and many of the black students here are secretly miserable many other students here are miserable as well 'a0because no one knows what it means to live!! they all act like robots whose only function is to do school work and protests now that i've got the negative outi will say however the school is very accommodating to mental health issues 'a0and professors are flexible with due dates as long as you speak with them before hand about your situation there are also a lot of different clubs and activities on campus and people who care strongly about different things berkeley was not for me but it doesn't mean it's not for you 'a0please don't just look at reviews actually visit the university sit in on classes and speak with students and staff and do this for every university you're considering then make a decision this is something i wish i would've done instead of listening to other people's opinions at the end of the day these are four years of your life not theirs best of luck to any prospects!in my opinion this is one of the most beautiful campuses it is built along the foothill of berkeley hill and one can either wander and lost in the giant ancient looking trees or step into the buildings and see the bay and the golden gate bridge the campus is always alive with students and activities around are so many diverse shops and the streets are vividly active and full of fun it is unlike any other universities that i have visited
